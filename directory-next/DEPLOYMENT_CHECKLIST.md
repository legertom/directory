# Deployment Checklist for 1pg.directory

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Code Ready
- [x] All files updated and tested
- [x] No console errors
- [x] Linting passes
- [x] Fonts included in repository

### 2. Environment Variables (Set in Vercel Dashboard)

Go to Vercel Project Settings → Environment Variables and add:

```
WEBSITE_URL=1pg.directory
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://1pg.directory
```

**Important:** Use your actual Vercel deployment URL for `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` initially, then update to `1pg.directory` once you configure your custom domain.

### 3. GitHub Setup

1. Initialize git (if not already):
   ```bash
   cd directory-next
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - production ready"
   ```

2. Create GitHub repository

3. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### 4. Vercel Deployment

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "Add New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js
5. **Add Environment Variables:**
   - `WEBSITE_URL` = `1pg.directory`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` = Your Vercel URL (or `https://1pg.directory` if custom domain is set)
6. Click "Deploy"

### 5. Custom Domain Setup (1pg.directory)

1. In Vercel project settings → Domains
2. Add `1pg.directory`
3. Follow DNS instructions to point your domain to Vercel
4. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to `https://1pg.directory` after DNS propagates

### 6. Post-Deployment Testing

- [ ] Visit your deployed site
- [ ] Upload a test CSV file
- [ ] Verify PDF generates correctly
- [ ] Check watermark shows "Generated by 1pg.directory" at bottom
- [ ] Test error handling with invalid files
- [ ] Test file size limit (try > 5MB file)
- [ ] Test with > 204 rows CSV

### 7. Test CSV for Verification

Create a test file `test.csv`:
```csv
leftText,middleText,rightText
Test,Location,555-1234
IT,Room 100,555-5678
Admin,Desk,555-9012
```

## 🚀 Quick Deploy Commands

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd directory-next

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Test build locally
npm run build

# If build succeeds, push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for production"
git push
```

## 📝 Notes

- The app defaults to `1pg.directory` if `WEBSITE_URL` env var is not set
- All fonts are included and will deploy automatically
- No database required for basic functionality
- Stripe integration can be added later

## ⚠️ Important

- Make sure `node_modules` is in `.gitignore` (already done)
- Don't commit `.env.local` files
- Fonts directory is included (needed for PDF generation)
