# ✅ READY TO DEPLOY - 1pg.directory

## Status: Production Ready ✅

The app has been tested and builds successfully. You're ready to push to GitHub and deploy to Vercel!

## Quick Deploy Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub

```bash
cd directory-next
git init  # if not already a git repo
git add .
git commit -m "Production ready - 1pg.directory"
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
2. Click "Add New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js ✅
5. **Add Environment Variables:**
   - `WEBSITE_URL` = `1pg.directory`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` = `https://1pg.directory` (or your Vercel URL initially)
6. Click "Deploy"

### 3. Configure Custom Domain (1pg.directory)

1. In Vercel project → Settings → Domains
2. Add `1pg.directory`
3. Follow DNS setup instructions
4. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` after DNS propagates

## What's Included

✅ Professional UI with loading states and error handling  
✅ CSV validation and file size limits  
✅ Watermark system (shows "Generated by 1pg.directory" for free tier)  
✅ PDF preview  
✅ All fonts included  
✅ SEO optimized  
✅ Production build tested and working  

## Default Behavior

- **Free Tier**: Watermark shows "Generated by 1pg.directory" at bottom of PDF
- **Paid Tier**: No watermark (ready for Stripe integration later)

## Test After Deployment

1. Upload a CSV file with format:
   ```csv
   leftText,middleText,rightText
   Test,Location,555-1234
   ```
2. Verify PDF generates
3. Check watermark appears at bottom
4. Test error handling (try invalid file)

## Next Steps (Optional - Later)

- Add Stripe for $10/year subscriptions
- Add user authentication
- Add database for subscription tracking

See `PROFESSIONALIZATION_SUMMARY.md` for subscription integration roadmap.
